## Note: we need to installed Android Studio to run this android mobile application
                                                                **Scenario**
**BabyBuy**
You have been commissioned to create an app that will help parents create a list of items they need to buy
before the birth of their baby and after. This app will store a list of items they need, as well as a description,
price and picture of the item. Extra features will allow optional location tracking of the shop they need to visit as
well as item delegation.
Typical user interactions
Emily is going to be a new mother and she is starting to prepare for the arrival of her new baby. She wants an
app that will help her prepare. She searches for baby apps on the play store and finds BabyBuy.
She downloads this app, registers an account and logs in. Inside this app she starts to list all of the things she
needs for her new baby, as well as upload/ take a picture of the item. As she has a supportive family, she is not
buying all of these things herself. After adding a few items to her list, she delegates one of these items to her
Mother, Susan. The app sends her an SMS text message with the name of the item, price and a description.
There is also an option to tag a location of where she can buy the item from, which will be useful for when she
is out shopping. Emily also has the ability to maintain her list with edit and delete options for each item as well
as being able to mark each item as purchased.
You are required to develop a prototype application for the Android operating systems which will include at
least all of the core requirements.
Core requirements of the app:
● Home screen - the point of entry for your app, suitably branded.
● User registration and login
● Create an item and upload / take a picture
● Manage my items
○ Delete items
○ Edit items
○ Mark as purchased
● Item Delegation
○ The ability to send an item as an SMS to another phone / contact with the item’s information.
Optional Desirable Requirements for the app:
● The ability to Geotag an item so the location of the item can be recorded and then viewed on a map.
● To include a full range of appropriate gesture control to improve the management of items. For
example, shake to clear an entry, swipe right to mark as purchased, swipe left to delete
There is no associated logo or house style for this app yet so you have free reign over the appearance.
